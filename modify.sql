# Modifying Data With SQL Cheatsheet

## Adding a Row to a Table


Inserting a single row:

```
INSERT INTO <table> VALUES (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...);
```

This will insert values in the order of the columns prescribed in the schema.

Examples:

```
INSERT INTO users VALUES  (1, "chalkers", "Andrew", "Chalkley");
INSERT INTO users VALUES  (2, "ScRiPtKiDdIe", "Kenneth", "Love");

INSERT INTO movies VALUES (3, "Starman", "Science Fiction", 1984);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (4, "Moulin Rouge!", "Musical", 2001);
```

Inserting a single row with values in any order:

```
INSERT INTO <table> (<column 1>, <column 2>) VALUES (<value 1>, <value 2>);
INSERT INTO <table> (<column 2>, <column 1>) VALUES (<value 2>, <value 1>);
```

Examples:

```
INSERT INTO users (username, first_name, last_name) VALUES ("chalkers", "Andrew", "Chalkley");
INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, username) VALUES  ("Kenneth", "Love", "ScRiPtKiDdIe");

INSERT INTO movies (title, genre, year_released) VALUES ("Starman", "Science Fiction", 1984);
INSERT INTO movies (title, year_released, genre) VALUES ("Moulin Rouge!", 2001,  "Musical");
```


## Adding Multiple Rows to a Table

Inserting multiple rows in a single statement:

```
INSERT INTO <table> (<column 1>, <column 2>, ...) 
             VALUES 
                    (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...),
                    (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...),
                    (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...);
```

Examples:

```
INSERT INTO users (username, first_name, last_name) 
    VALUES 
                  ("chalkers", "Andrew", "Chalkley"),
                  ("ScRiPtKiDdIe", "Kenneth", "Love");

INSERT INTO movies (title, genre, year_released) 
     VALUES 
                   ("Starman", "Science Fiction", 1984),
                   ("Moulin Rouge!", "Musical", 2001);
```

## Updating All Rows in a Table

An update statement for all rows:

```
UPDATE <table> SET <column> = <value>;
```

The `=` sign is different from an equality operator from a `WHERE` condition. It's an _assignment operator_ because you're assigning a new value to something.

Examples:

```
UPDATE users SET password = "thisisabadidea";
UPDATE products SET price = 2.99;
```

Update multiple columns in all rows:

```
UPDATE <table> SET <column 1> = <value 1>, <column 2> = <value 2>;
```

Examples:

```
UPDATE users SET first_name = "Anony", last_name = "Moose";
UPDATE products SET stock_count = 0, price = 0;
```

## Updating Specific Rows

An update statement for specific rows:

```
UPDATE <table> SET <column> = <value> WHERE <condition>;
```
Examples:

```
UPDATE users SET password = "thisisabadidea" WHERE id = 3;
UPDATE blog_posts SET view_count = 1923 WHERE title = "SQL is Awesome";
```

Update multiple columns for specific rows:

```
UPDATE <table> SET <column 1> = <value 1>, <column 2> = <value 2> WHERE <condition>;
```

Examples:

```
UPDATE users SET entry_url = "/home", last_login = "2016-01-05" WHERE id = 329;
UPDATE products SET status = "SOLD OUT", availability = "In 1 Week" WHERE stock_count = 0;
```

## Removing Data from All Rows in a Table

To delete all rows from a table:

```
DELETE FROM <table>;
```

Examples:

```
DELETE FROM logs;
DELETE FROM users;
DELETE FROM products;
```


##  Removing Specific Rows

To delete specific rows from a table:

```
DELETE FROM <table> WHERE <condition>;
```

Examples:

```
DELETE FROM users WHERE email = "andrew@teamtreehouse.com";
DELETE FROM movies WHERE genre = "Musical";
DELETE FROM products WHERE stock_count = 0;
```


## Transactions


Switch autocommit off and begin a transaction:

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
```

Or simply:

```
BEGIN;
```

To save all results of the statements after the start of the transaction to disk:

```
COMMIT;
```

To reset the state of the database to before the beginning  of the transaction:

```
ROLLBACK;
